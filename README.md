# AdventureWorks-Analysis-Project
AdventureWorks sales analysis and vizualization using PowerBI. This projects consisted of various large datasets, cleaned and all connected together to analyze and gain insight. Using Power Query Editor to clean the datasets and Entity Relations Diagram to create relationships between the various datasets.

## OVERVIEW
The dataset was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ukveteran/adventure-works)

### ER DIAGRAM
After the datasets were cleaned, I created relationships with them to enable efficient querying. Instead of performing complex joins or searches across multiple tables, relationships enable direct navigation between related entities, improving query performance.
